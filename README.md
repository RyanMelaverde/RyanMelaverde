👋 Hello there! I'm Ryan Harris, the CFO/COO of Mela Verde Trading PTE LTD, where I drive the business management strategies behind Mela Verde. My journey into efficiency and productivity optimization stems from managing and leading teams within the dynamic landscape of the film and television industry.

🎬 With a rich background in managing and inspiring teams in film and television, I've honed my skills in orchestrating seamless operations. Now, at Mela Verde, I channel that expertise into organizing the automation of business systems, constantly seeking ways to enhance efficiency and elevate performance.

💻 Additionally, as our company expands, I'm delving deeper into the realm of DEX (Decentralized Exchanges), navigating the financial technology space while applying my love for innovative solutions.

⛰️❄️ Beyond the world of finance and technology, I find solace and inspiration in the serene cold snowy mountains and the invigorating hot sunny beaches and lush outback landscapes. Balancing these diverse landscapes mirrors my approach to problem-solving—embracing varied perspectives to tackle challenges.
